# Satellite Communication Latency Simulator

Physics-based simulation of satellite communication latency for LEO, MEO, and GEO orbits.

## Overview
This project models satellite communication delays using signal propagation physics
to compare architectural tradeoffs between orbital regimes.

## Technologies
- Python
- Physics-based modeling
- Object-oriented design
